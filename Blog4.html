 <h2>Hopper's Fables: Rubric </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Sep 26 - Oct 03)</small></p>
        <p> During this week we will be focus on the rubric and the storylines of our language.
        We split out the parts of the rubric and then we contributed to each other work </p>
        
       <p> Rubric (rough draft)</p>
        
<ul>
  <li>Hints:</li><p> Help and documentation: even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, 
  it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, 
  focused on the user’s task,list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large</p>
  <li>User control and freedom:</li><p>
   Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a 
  clearly marked ‘emergency exit’ to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
  Support undo and redo.</p>
  <li>Error prevention:</li><p> Even better than good error messages 
  is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place</p>
  <li>Match between the system and the real world:</li><p>The system should speak the user’s language, with words, 
  phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system oriented terms. Follow real world conventions, 
  making information appear in a natural and logical order.
</p>
   <li>Consistency and standards:</li><p> users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, 
  or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.
</p>
   <li> Recognition rather than recall: </li><p> make objects actions and options visible. 
  The users should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
  Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate.
</p>
   <li>Flexibility and efficiency of use: </li><p>  accelerators—unseen by the novice user—may often speed up the 
  interaction for the expert user to such an extent that the system can cater for both inexperienced and experienced users. 
  Allow users to tailor frequent actions.
</p>
   <li> Aesthetic and minimalist design:</li><p>  dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or 
  rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in a  dialogue competes with the relevant units 
  of information and diminishes their relative visibility</p>
</ul>
      <p color: "pink"> Storyline idea</p> 
        
        <p>Decorating a pumpkin<p> There are decorating sets for pumpkins that you can find at the Home Depot for example, 
        they come with eyes, nose, boots, hats, and many other decorations for pumpkins.  
        We can put all those items in a vending machine and if the kid solves a math problem correctly, 
        the machine dispense the eyes. But for the more interesting decorations, he math problem is harder.
