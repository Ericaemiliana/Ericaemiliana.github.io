### Welcome to my research blog with CRA-W CREU program.
My name is Erica Pantoja and I am a senior majored in computer science at Kennesaw State University. In this Blog I will inform the progress of my collaborative research which is focus on the analyzing the potential of learning Reading and math skills. Every Friday night my blog will be updated, so you will see the work I did during that week and the task that I will be working on during the follow week.
