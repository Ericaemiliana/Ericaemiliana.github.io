        <h3>Among all block programming languages is there one with the same purpose than ours? </h3>
        <p>Accordign to my reseach so far, there is not one with the exactly same purpose than ours but the closest ones to ours 
          are Scratch, Alice,and the websites tutorials; code.org, Khan Academy, and, CS Unplugged.<p>
<h3>Similarities to our programming language</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Scratch</li><br>
    <p> Main topics cover both specific operations and project-based instruction with a primary focus on how to use the operations.</p>
  <li>Alice</li><br>
    <p>  It is a 3D programming environment focused on creating animations and story telling.It is focused on fundamental programming concepts.</p>
  
</ul>
        <h4>The folloign article is a very nice article about these four virtual education environments </h4>
        <p><cite>Empowering K–12 Students With Disabilities to Learn Computational Thinking and Computer Programming<cite> by
            Ismael Maya and others. Prnted in 2015. <p>
            
          <p>Moreover, there are very interesting articles that 
          claim that the use of these enviroments in education improve the leanring of students with and without disabilities.
          For example, the article called Activities-Oriented Science Instruction for students with disabilities repots that in several 
          investignation in scinece education, students with disabiliites overwhelmingly reported enjoying the activities-oriented instruction more than textbook instruction </p>

<h4> The purpose of our language includes programming thinking. so how other block languages are currently doing this? </h4>
<p> I found several articles that compare the effectiveness of certain block languages out there when it comes to 
          Education in programming thinkg. For insntace. the article, <cite> Comparing Elementary Students' Programming Success based on Programming Environment.</cite>
          shows an study that compares attitudinal and learning outcomes of 7thgrade students programming in Logo and Scratch. And,  Results showes that learning Scratch first can provide a better understanding of basic programming concept for novices in elementary school than Logo</p>

 <p><cite>Comparing Elementary Students' Programming Success based on Programming Environment.<cite> by
            Monika Miladenovi, and others. Prnted in 2016. <p>
    
    
    </p>According to my reseach so far, <h4>Scratcht</h4> seems to be the the most efficent block language  when it comes to computational thinking and computational practices what is it so good to know. in this way
   we can use Scratch a model. Our version will be like Scratch with improvemets for studetns with disabilities.</u> 
   The following article cliams how Scratch is one of the most efficent virtual enviroment in educaiton.</p>
   
   <p><cite>Visual programming languages integrated across the curriculum in elementary school: A two year case study using “Scratch” in five schools.<cite> by
           Esteban Vazquez-Cano, and others. Prnted in 2016. <p>
        
        
 <p> Task for this week</p>


   <ul>
  <li>Continue doing reseach about how to accomplish the wished characteristics of our lerning program </li>
  <li>Have a better structure of our language</li>
  <li>Get familiarized with Blockly </li>
  </ul>
