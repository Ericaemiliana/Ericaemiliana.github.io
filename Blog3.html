 <h2>Brainstorming- characteristics of our language </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Sep 20 - Sept 26)</small></p>
        <p> During this week we am doing more reseach about existing block programming languages, especially on those that
       according professionals are best block programming languages in education. Among those languages are Scracth, Scratch Jr. 
        App Inventor, Lego, and Alice. Our research for this week is focused on existing evaluations of those top block programming languages
          in education. Base on those evaluations we will start elaborating the reubric of our block programming language.
          What wil make our language sucessful? What characteristics it must to have?  What would be nice to have? </p>
