        <p id = "colorB3"> Is there one language with the same purpose than ours? </p>
        <p>Accordign to my reseach so far, there is not one with the exactly same purpose than ours but the closest ones to ours 
          are Scratch, Alice,and the websites tutorials; code.org, Khan Academy, and, CS Unplugged.<p>
<p id = "colorB3">Similarities to our programming language</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Scratch</li><br>
    <p> Main topics cover both specific operations and project-based instruction with a primary focus on how to use the operations.</p>
  <li>Alice</li><br>
    <p>  It is a 3D programming environment focused on creating animations and story telling.It is focused on fundamental programming concepts.</p>
  
</ul>

        <p><cite>Empowering K–12 Students With Disabilities to Learn Computational Thinking and Computer Programming<cite> by
            Ismael Maya and others. Prnted in 2015. <p>
          
         <p><cite>Activities-Oriented Science Instruction for Students with Disabilities</cite> by Margo A Mastropieri and others. Painted in 1999.</p>
            
          <p> This article claims that the use of block languages in education improve the leanring of 
            students with and without disabilities. For instance, the artilce reports that students with disabiliites overwhelmingly 
            enjoy the activities-oriented instruction more than textbook instruction </p>
         
        
           
        <cite> Comparing Elementary Students' Programming Success based on Programming Environment.</cite>
          <p> this artilce shows an study that compares attitudinal and learning outcomes of 7thgrade students programming in Logo and Scratch. 
  And, results showes that learning Scratch first can provide a better understanding of basic programming concept for novices in elementary school than Logo</p>

  <li>Continue doing reseach about how to accomplish the wished characteristics of our lerning program </li>
  <li>Have a better structure of our language</li>
  <li>Get familiarized with Blockly </li>
