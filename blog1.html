  <h2>Terminology:)  What? Where? How? </h2>
  
  <p>During this week, I am documenting the words used in Snap and Frozen. Terminology is a 
  very important factor in any programming language specially in programming languages designed 
  for kids. We want our players be able to navigate easily through the storylines and they can understand and
  follow the instructions easly too. Short words? one workd for instruction?
  There are many words with same meaning so which one to choose? why? 
  which words are used in other block programming langauges? Answer these questions is my task during this week 
  (Dec 1 to Dec 9)</p>
