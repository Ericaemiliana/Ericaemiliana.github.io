  <tr>
    <td><u>Hints</u></td><p> Help and documentation: even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. Any such information should be easy to search, 
    focused on the user’s task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.</p>

  <tr>
    <td><u>Error Prevention</u><p>Error prevention: even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. </p></td>
   
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><u>Visibility of System Status</u><p>Visibility of system status: the system should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within reasonable time.</p></td>
   
     
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><u> Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors</u><p>error messages should be expressed in plain language (no codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution</p><td>
   </tr>
   
  <tr>
     
 <td><u> Consistency and Standards</u><p>Consistency and standards: users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform conventions.</p><td>
