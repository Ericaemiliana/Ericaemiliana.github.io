<h2>Hopper's Fables: Rubric (rough draft) </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Nov 7 - Nov 14)</small></p>
       
      <p> This was my first acm conference I attended and I enjoyed it so much. Hopper's Fables
          is a great project. After our presentation studetns and adviser reached out on us to get to know more about Hopper's
          Fables. It was certainly a great expereince, I ejoyed presenting our project, meeting other students and mentors, and 
          lisening to other students' projects. I am so happy I attended to this conference, this conferences help me 
        to feel passionated about Hopper's Fables, I learned so much from other projects and I got interested on some of them.</p>
