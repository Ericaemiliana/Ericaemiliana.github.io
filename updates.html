         <h2> Good news from SIGCSE Conference</h2>
        <p> This week I met my groupmates and we are ready to move forward with the coding and graphics. 
         
         My task for this week are so many; 
         
         1. Read the Common Core Standards for Mathematics article and look at Common core vocabulary. 
         2. Create a main point summary from the above article and regarding common core vocabulary documentation.
         3. Come up with 4 math problems for each scene in our "First Day of School"
         4. Design 5 to 10 blocks for each scene. </p>
        
        <p id="date"><small>(March - March 17)</small></p>	
        
        
        <h2>  Ready to start coding :)  </h2>
        <p id="date"><small>(March 4 - March 10)</small></p>	
        
        <p> Work accomplished: I feel more comfortable with JavaScript functions and understand better JavaScript code behind the
        blocks we create in Blockly. I also gained new JQuery skills, like how to design rows (next, previous) used in a 
        gallery slider. 
        
        I look forward to meet my groupmates after the conference so I can know what is the next step to move on and start 
        working on it. 
        
        </p>         

        
        
        <h2> New skills</h2>
        <p id="date"><small>(Feb 25 - March 3)</small></p>	
        
        <p> Work accomplished: I gave up with canvas in JavaScript because it is so difficult to work with canvas when it comes to 
         make the character move around the grid. I figured out that we do not really need to do this, we can have a very nice interaction with 
         the student in the storylines without using canvas.  As we are not working on the 
         grocery storyline anymore for now,I have been working on my Illustrator skills 
         during this week so I can have a good input in the graphics work for this new storyline "First Day of School " :)
         
         What I learned this week was new features in JavaScript, html, CSS and JQuery. JQuery is very new for me, and I am surprise
         how amaizing it in the desing of a web platform.
         
         As I mentioned in my previous post, I will not atteneded to the SIGCSE Conference, so I am going to use this comming week 
         to improve my programming skills with JavaScript and JQuery so I have a good iput in the programming part of our stotylines. 
         
         
        </p>
         		
         <h2> Evaluation of Terminology Done</h2>
         <p id="date"><small>(Feb 19 - Feb 24)</small></p>	
        <p> Work Accomplished: As I mentioned in my past post, I have been working on the evaluation of the terminology used in Snap and Frozen
        against our rubric and I finally finished it. According my evaluation of Snap and Frozen, Frozen is a great language to 
        follow as example for our language. It meets the requirements of our 3-point category in our rubric. For instance, in Frozen
         the purpose of the application is clear and it is easily to understand the assigned tasks, it gives detail and specific feedback, and 
         the usage of visual representations is diverse and appropriate for the assigned tasks. On the other hand, Snap is not very clear with the purpose of the application; instructions are not
         clear and terminology correlates to programming terminology but is not applicable to the age group. So, in my opinion Snap is not
         a good block programming language to follow as example for our language.
         
         This week, I Also did some basic blocks with Blockly to start getting playing with them 
         in the web interface and understand better the connection of the blocks with JavaScript. 
         
         What I learned from this week was how to set the environment in my computer for Blokcly from the GitHub page. I also, create 
         basic blocks and I kind of understand better now the JavaScript functions behind the blocks. 
         
         Unfortunately, I will not attend to the SIGCSE Conference. I have so much work to accomplish for my classes during these two weeks and I decided not to go to the conference so I can focus on my assignments. 
         
         Next week, I want to have a solid understanding on how to create our blocks in Blockly and functions in JavaScript.

         <h2>JavaScript course !</h2>		
         <p id="date"><small>(Feb 12 - Feb 18)</small></p>		
         		
         <p>Work Accomplished:  I am still working on my evaluation about Frozen and Snap terminology against our rubric. :( 		
         I like programming better than writing and this week is an example of this. I chose this week to learned more about 		
         JavaScript and other web development tools. </p>		
         <p>Lesson's Learned: Canvas in JavaScript</p>		
         <p>Goal: Finish my evaluation of the terminology, finish poster, and have and advance of our programming work.</p>		
         		
         		
         <h2>Programming and evaluation of terminology!</h2>		
         <p id="date"><small>(Feb 06 - Feb 11)</small></p>		
         		
        <p> Work Accomplished: During the week I met with my groupmates to ensure we are fine with our graphics and move to the next step.		
          I also did a small evaluation of Frozen terminology against our rubric. Moreover, I learned about javaScript and JQuery. 		
         </p>		
        		
        <p>Lesson's Learned: This week, I learned the importance of terminology in our language. My groupmates came out with 		
          an excellent idea for student survey activity and I really like it. </p>		
         		
        <p>Goal: Finish evaluation about Frozen and Snap against our rubric and the programming work before the conference </p>		
         		
   		
 		
         <h2>Graphics Done  !</h2>		
         <p id="date"><small>(Feb 01 - Feb 05)</small></p>		
         <p>Work Accomplished: This week I finished the ingredients graphics for our language, the consent form, and the CITI training.		
          I used Illustrator for the graphics and I enjoyed it so much. This was my first time using Illustrator and I am surprise how incredible things I can do with this		
         magic software.  </p>		
         		
         <p>Lesson's Learned: I learned how to use many of the tools in Illustrator, I learned the importance of the CITI		
         training, and the rules for the consent and IRB forms. I really appreciated that parents are aware of their kids 		
         participation in research survey activities through school and that kids are not forced to participated if they do not feel 		
         comfortable participating. </p>		
         		
         <p>Goal Next week: The goal for next week is do an evaluation of Frozen and Snap terminology against our rubric, 		
         and work on poster for conference.</p>

         <p id="date"><small>(Dec 15 - Dec 31)</small></p>		
         <p> 		
           During this time, I was supposed to learn canvas in JavaScript and figure out how to display 		
           characters in the grid. I have been working on this but I cannot figure it out yet. In order to success 		
           in this task, I am using free tutorials online about graphics in JavaScript and Udemy academy 		
           courses on graphics with JavaScript. For instance, this one:https://www.udemy.com/how-to-program-games/

         <h2>Terminology: Snap </h2>		
         <p id="date"><small>(Dec 9 - Dec 15)</small></p>		
         <p> 		
           Snap terminology is huge. Snap shares many words with other programming languages like frozen and scratch. 		
           However, it has some uncommon words that in my opinion they are not clear for kids.

  <h2> Keep doing reseach about existing block languages</h2>		
      <p id="date"><small>(Sep 19 - Sept 26)</small></p>		
     		
      <p> During this week we are continuing doing research about other block programming languages and their evaluation		
      in education. I found out very interesting artilces that evaluate Scratch and App Inventor on programming skills, but 		
      have not found an exisiting block programming language that foucus on math and reading skills. This is why 		
      our language will be unique and most sucessful. Through out our storylines, kids will not only gain programming skills		
        but also math and reading skills.

         <p> During this week I am doing more reseach about existing block programming languages, especially on those that		
        according professionals are best block programming languages in education. Among those languages are Scracth, Scratch Jr. 		
         App Inventor, Lego, and Alice. Our task is do research about the evaluation of those top block programming languages so 		
           we can start elaborating the reubric of our block programming language. What wil make our language unique? 		
         What characteristics it must to have?  What would be nice to have? </p>
