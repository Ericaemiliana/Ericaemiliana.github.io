 <h2>Hopper's Fables: Rubric (3 point evaluation) </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Oct 12 - Oct 17)</small></p>
        
        <p> During this week our mentor introduced to us a 3 point rubric evaluation. And we will
        be updating our rubric during this week according to this 3 point evaluation format. This 3 point rubric 
          evaluation is very helpful, I can see now clearlier the purpose of the rubric and the importance of it. 
          This rubric system is specific and simple. I love it.  Each member of the group did a 3-point system according 
          to the part they were assinged and we have combined them to make a our pre-final rubric. The final rubric is our
         pre-final rubric with changes from our mentor.
