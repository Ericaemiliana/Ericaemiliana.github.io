<p>My name is Erica Pantoja and I am a senior majored in computer science at Kennesaw State University. In this Blog I will inform the progress of my collaborative research which is focus on the analyzing the potential of learning Reading and math skills. Every Friday night my blog will be updated, so you will see the work I did during that week and the task that I will be working on during the follow week. </p>

<p>Enjoy reading my blog as I do so by working on this project with amazing classmates and Adviser :) !!</p>

        <h3>Among all block programming languages is there one with the same purpose than ours? </h3>
        <p>Accordign to my reseach so far, there is not one with the exactly same purpose than ours but the closest ones to ours 
          are Scratch, Alice,and the websites tutorials; code.org, Khan Academy, and, CS Unplugged.<p>
<h3>Similarities to our programming language</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Scratch</li><br>
    <p> Main topics cover both specific operations and project-based instruction<br>
      with a primary focus on how to use the operations.</p>
    
  <li>Alice</li><br>
    <p>  It is a 3D programming environment focused on creating animations and story telling. <br>
      It is focused on fundamental programming concepts.</p>
  
</ul>

          <p>Neverthless, there are very interesting articles that 
          cliam that the use of these enviroments in education improve the leanring of students with and without disabilities.
          For example, the article called Activities-Oriented Science Instruction for students with disabilities repots that in several 
          investignation in scinece education, students with disabiliites overwhelmingly reported enjoying the activities-oriented instruction more than textbook instruction </p>
