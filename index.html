        <p> 
          Snap terminology is clear and neat; One word is used for instruction and they are short and common words.

        <p>During this week, I am documenting the words used in Snap and Frozen. Terminology is a very important factor in any programming language specially...</p>

        <p id = "date"> <small> (Oct 18- Nov 6) </small></p>
        <p> During this two weeks, I have been playing with Blockly, JavaSrcript and HTML. I hadn't used them
          before but now after messing around with these tools I feel more confident about our project.
          I am really enjoying to learn JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Blockly, I spend hours playing with them and It is never enough.
          There is a lot we can do with these amazing tools. 
        </p>
        
        <p> During these two weeks we were also working on our abstract and submitting paperwork for conferences :)</p>

 <h2> Keep doing reseach about existing block languages</h2>
     <p id="date"><small>(Sep 19 - Sept 26)</small></p>
    
     <p> During this week we are continuing doing research about other block programming languages and their evaluation
     in education. I found out very interesting artilces that evaluate Scratch and App Inventor on programming skills, but 
     have not found an exisiting block programming language that foucus on math and reading skills. This is why 
     our language will be unique and most sucessful. Through out our storylines, kids will not only gain programming skills
       but also math and reading skills.

 <h2>Brainstorming- Characteristics of our language </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Sep 12 - Sept 19)</small></p>
        <p> During this week I am doing more reseach about existing block programming languages, especially on those that
       according professionals are best block programming languages in education. Among those languages are Scracth, Scratch Jr. 
        App Inventor, Lego, and Alice. Our task is do research about the evaluation of those top block programming languages so 
          we can start elaborating the reubric of our block programming language. What wil make our language unique? 
        What characteristics it must to have?  What would be nice to have? </p>

        <p id="date"><small>(Sept 3 - Sept 12)</small></p>
        <p> My task during this week is to do reseach about existing block programming languages, read the article 
          <cite> Predicting Quality in Educational Software: Evaluating for Learning, Usability and the Synergy between them 
   </cite>by David Squires and Jenny Preece, and get familiarized with Scratch and Blockly.</p>
