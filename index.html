        <h3>Among all block programming languages is there one with the same purpose than ours? </h3>
        <p>Accordign to my reseach so far, there is not one with the exactly same purpose than ours but the closest ones to ours 
          are Scratch, Alice,and the websites tutorials; code.org, Khan Academy, and, CS Unplugged.<p>
<h3>Similarities to our programming language</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>Scratch</li><br>
    <p> Main topics cover both specific operations and project-based instruction with a primary focus on how to use the operations.</p>
  <li>Alice</li><br>
    <p>  It is a 3D programming environment focused on creating animations and story telling.It is focused on fundamental programming concepts.</p>
  
</ul>
        <h4>The folloign article is a very nice article about these four virtual education environments </h4>
        <p><cite>Empowering K–12 Students With Disabilities to Learn Computational Thinking and Computer Programming<cite> by
            Ismael Maya and others. Prnted in 2015. <p>
            
          <p>Moreover, there are very interesting articles that 
          claim that the use of these enviroments in education improve the leanring of students with and without disabilities.
          For example, the article called Activities-Oriented Science Instruction for students with disabilities repots that in several 
          investignation in scinece education, students with disabiliites overwhelmingly reported enjoying the activities-oriented instruction more than textbook instruction </p>

<h4> The purpose of our language includes programming thinking. so how other block languages are currently doing this? </h4>
<p> I found several articles that compare the effectiveness of certain block languages out there when it comes to 
          Education in programming thinkg. For insntace. the article, <cite> Comparing Elementary Students' Programming Success based on Programming Environment.</cite>
          shows an study that compares attitudinal and learning outcomes of 7thgrade students programming in Logo and Scratch. And,  Results showes that learning Scratch first can provide a better understanding of basic programming concept for novices in elementary school than Logo</p>

 <p><cite>Comparing Elementary Students' Programming Success based on Programming Environment.<cite> by
            Monika Miladenovi, and others. Prnted in 2016. <p>
    
    
    </p>According to my reseach so far, <h4>Scratcht</h4> seems to be the the most efficent block language  when it comes to computational thinking and computational practices what is it so good to know. in this way
   we can use Scratch a model. Our version will be like Scratch with improvemets for studetns with disabilities.</u> 
   The following article cliams how Scratch is one of the most efficent virtual enviroment in educaiton.</p>

 <h2> Keep doing reseach about existing block languages</h2>
     <p id="date"><small>(Sep 19 - Sept 26)</small></p>
     <p> During this week we are continuing doing research about other block programming languages and their evaluation
     in education. I found out very interesting artilces that evaluate Scratch and App Inventor on programming skills, but 
     have not found an exisiting block programming language that foucus on math and reading skills. This is why 
     our language will be unique and most sucessful. Through out our storylines, kids will not only gain programming skills
       but also math and reading skills.

 <h2>Brainstorming- Characteristics of our language </h2>
<p id="date"><small>(Sep 12 - Sept 19)</small></p>
        <p> During this week I am doing more reseach about existing block programming languages, especially on those that
       according professionals are best block programming languages in education. Among those languages are Scracth, Scratch Jr. 
        App Inventor, Lego, and Alice. Our task is do research about the evaluation of those top block programming languages so 
          we can start elaborating the reubric of our block programming language. What wil make our language unique? 
        What characteristics it must to have?  What would be nice to have? </p>

     <h2>Reseach About Existing Block Programming Languages</h2>
        <p id="date"><small>(Sept 3 - Sept 12)</small></p>
        <p> My task during this week is to do reseach about existing block programming languages, read the article 
          <cite> Predicting Quality in Educational Software: Evaluating for Learning, Usability and the Synergy between them 
   </cite>by David Squires and Jenny Preece, and get familiarized with Scratch and Blockly.</p>
